# SQLearning
This project was developed in early 2023, when i was on vacation, but with a desire to create a full Back end project from scratch.

<br>

## Objective
SQLearning primary objective was developing a RESTful API with different solving methods for requests. In the project I used mainly MySQL, Express and Sequelize to create a responsive system where you can Create, Read and Delete Users, Techs and Addresses, all using Model/Controller Architecture.

<br>

## Some Important Learnings
- Usage of Sequelize ORM to improve Database handling.
- Usage of Model Relationships.
- Implementation of Controllers to handle Requests.
- Database and app configurations.

<br>

## Accessing SQLearning
You should have MySQL and Git installed and running in your machine. If you have different MySQL enviroment variables than default, you may create a .env file using .env.example as your model. Once you've configured all variables as you prefer, you're ready to go.

## Endpoints
Here you can check the routes you can use to manipulate the Database. To properly create your requests, I recommend you to use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).
